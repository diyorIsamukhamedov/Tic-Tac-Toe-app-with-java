# Tic-Tac-Toe-app-with-java

Objectives
In this stage, I should write a program that:

Prints an empty grid at the beginning of the game.
Creates a game loop where the program asks the user to enter the cell coordinates, analyzes the move for correctness and shows a grid with the changes if everything is okay.
Ends the game when someone wins or there is a draw.

Example
The greater-than symbol followed by a space (> ) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.

Example 1.
